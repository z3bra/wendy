wendy
=====
Inotify-based directory watcher.

An arbitrary command is run whenever one or more filesystem events occur.
Events are reported through the inotify API, which is specific to the
Linux kernel.

Features
-----
- Event(s) selection done with bitwise mask
- Automatically watch new directories in recursive mode
- Exports event informations in the command environment
- Path can be specified as argument or from `STDIN`.

Usage
-----
Refer to wendy(1) manual page for details and examples.
The below commands are provided as a quick introduction.

Recompile a project when a source file changes:

	ls *.[ch] | wendy make

Dynamic preview of a manual page (note the use of simple quotes):

	export MANPAGER=/bin/cat
	wendy -w manual.1 sh -c 'clear; man ./$WENDY_INODE'

Synchronize the local directory with a remote one. The value `394`
is a sum of events: `MODIFY, CLOSE_WRITE, MOVED_TO, CREATE`:

	wendy -rd -m 394 -w . rsync -av . remote:/dest
