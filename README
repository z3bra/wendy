wendy
=====
Inotify-based directory watcher.

An arbitrary command is run whenever one or more filesystem events occur.
Events are reported through the inotify API, which is specific to the
Linux kernel.

Features
-----
- Event(s) selection done with bitwise mask
- Automatically watch new directories in recursive mode
- Exports event informations in the command environment
- Path can be specified as argument or from `STDIN`.

Usage
-----
Refer to wendy(1) manual page for details and examples.
The below commands are provided as a quick introduction.

These commands will helps you recompile a project, preview the manual
page and upload it to a remote location (each running in a separate
terminal):

	ls *.[ch] | wendy make
	wendy -w manual.1 sh -c 'clear;PAGER=cat man ./$WENDY_INODE'
	wendy -rd -m 394 -w . rsync -av . remote:/dest

Note: the numerical value "394" is a combination of event: MODIFY,
CLOSE_WRITE, MOVED_TO, CREATE. See `MASKS` in wendy(1) for all supported
events and their numeric values.
